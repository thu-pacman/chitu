# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Q: What's the difference between FP8 and INT8 models?
The official DeepSeek models are released in FP8 format, which offers a larger dynamic range compared to INT8. INT8 models are derived from FP8 models through quantization. This quantization process may potentially introduce some degradation in model performance.
